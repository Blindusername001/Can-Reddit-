Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses. Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day. My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits. Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid? Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper. Happy New Year</td>\n",

       "30  Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you. Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses. Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day. My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits. Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid? Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper. Happy New Year   \n",

Shorting works when shit is based on fundamentals. When shits decoupled, shorting just leads to cycles of highs and lows that draw in other investors and increase the price gradually.  \\n\\n\\nSo I'm in on GME, Macys, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond   \n",

       "30  Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you.   \\nBeen FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses.   \\nFinally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day.  \\nMy question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits.   \\nIs this something that I can repeat again without being stupid?  Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper.   \\nHappy New Year   \n",

       "      <td>Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you. Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses. Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day. My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits. Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid? Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper. Happy New Year</td>\n",

       "5  Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you. Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses. Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day. My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits. Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid? Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper. Happy New Year   \n",

       "      <td>Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you. Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses. Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day. My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits. Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid? Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper. Happy New Year</td>\n",

       "5  Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you. Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses. Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day. My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits. Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid? Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper. Happy New Year   \n",
